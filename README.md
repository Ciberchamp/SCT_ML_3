Cat & Dog Image Classifier with SVM & Streamlit

This project is a machine learning application that classifies images as either cats or dogs. It uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with features extracted from the powerful VGG16 deep learning model to achieve high accuracy. The project is deployed as a simple, interactive web app using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Features
- **High-Accuracy Classification**: Achieved **88% accuracy** on the test set.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction**: Uses **Transfer Learning** with the pre-trained VGG16 model to generate powerful image features.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with **Streamlit** to allow users to upload their own images for live prediction.
- 
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **scikit-learn**: For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For loading the pre-trained VGG16 model and extracting features.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing (resizing, loading).
- **Streamlit**: To create and run the interactive web application.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the trained SVM model.
